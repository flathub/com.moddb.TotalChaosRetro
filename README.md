# Total Chaos - Retro Edition

This project contains files to build [Total Chaos - Retro Edition](https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos/downloads/total-chaos-directors-cut-retro-edition-140) as flatpak app.

Retro Edition has reduced texture resolutions and poly-counts for improved performance. Save files from other versions of Total Chaos are not compatible.

This project is based on [com.moddb.TotalChaos](https://github.com/flathub/com.moddb.TotalChaos).
